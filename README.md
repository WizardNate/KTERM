# KTERM
KTERM is an interactive fiction game I am currently working on.  It will be updated as I progress further with coding.


---Actions---
To do something in the game, simply type out what you want to do.

Sometimes however, the typed commands don't always work as intended.  For example, in order to ask a person something, 
you should first type "ask [name of character]" to get a list of what you can ask about.  How it appears in game---> (You can ask about name, age, birthday. etc. etc.)

With that list, type something like "ask [name of character] about [one of the items on the list]"

I'm trying to fix this to make it more user friendly, but I will have to change the Inform 7 script to do so, so bear with me on this.



---Locations---

As of right now, there is only one location.  Where you start is basically what you get; for now.  If you find yourself not being able to progress further
in the story, it's most likely because you can't.  I just haven't gotten that far yet.
